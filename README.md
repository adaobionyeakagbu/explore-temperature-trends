Exploring Weather Trends 
by Adaobi Onyeakagbu

The general idea of this project is to visualize and analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in Hamburg to overall global temperature trends using 
- SQL to query the data from the database
- Python and Pandas to analyse the data

Observations
1. There has been a 1.1 degree rise in average temperature globally and a 2.9 degree (C) rise in temperature in Hamburg, since the temperature readings began (Mid 1700s).
2. Fluctuations in Hamburg's temperature had a steady effect on the global temperatures in earlier times. However, these temperature trends stopped mirroring each other from around 1900. Global temperature seems to follow a steady rising pattern after then.
3. The temperature difference between Hamburg and the world has changed over time.
4. There is a noticeably steep rise in temperature from the end of the 20th century to the 2000s in both Hamburg and the world which indicates a large increase in global warming events in this era.
